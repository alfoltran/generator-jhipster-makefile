# generator-jhipster-makefile
> Yeoman generator to create a JHipster Makefile and Bash scripts

## Description

A generator, very specific yet, to generate some build, test and deployment scripts.

Always use Makefile, Bash, GitLab and Discord.

**Use it on an "as-is" basis to create your own generator.**

## Installation

First, install [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) and generator-jhipster-makefile using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (we assume you have pre-installed [node.js](https://nodejs.org/)).

```bash
npm install -g yo
npm install -g generator-jhipster-makefile
```

Then generate your new project:
